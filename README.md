# MIT 20.440 final project
 - Title: **Metabolic Modeling of Cyanobacteria for Evolutionary Inference**
 - Authors: **Dylan Hirsch, Paul Kramer y Rosado**
## Overview
This directory contains version-controlled information about our final project for the MIT subject 20.440 (Analysis of Biological Networks). The project aims to model the metabolism of cyanobacteria in different environmental conditions in order to understand the evolution of their metabolism, and also their fitness in different environments. In order to do this, we will analyze the flux distributions using flux balance analysis (FBA) and flux variability analysis (FVA) using the the constraint-based reconstruction and analysis (COBRA) package in python [Ebrahim].


## Data
Our main source of data is the available genome-scale metabolic model of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 [@joshi_modeling_2017] from BiGG Models [@king_bigg_2015]. This model contains information about the metabolic reactions of this organism and
